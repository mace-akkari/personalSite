            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                I'm an alumnus of <a href="https://makers.tech">Makers</a>, looking for my first role as a Junior Web Developer.
                I originally studied Computer Science at Kingston University before becoming a Personal Trainer. Training individuals 
                on a daily basis has enhanced my people skills. Every client is different, and I am able to adapt effectively to each one. 
                Similar to programming, each client is like a project and has specifications of what they want to achieve within a given time. 
                My client, now mentor, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-orrell-86a5a236">Patrick Orrell</a>, has helped guide me during my transition.
                <br />
                <br />
                I began my coding journey while trying to find an app that would help my clients and I with their training routine. I wanted an app that would 
                allow me to take videos of them while they were doing their workout, track their progress and a booking system. As most of them would need a few 
                sessions before fully understanding how to do the routine properly, this was affecting our results and having an app like this, it would have 
                accelerated their progression and reach their target faster. I couldn’t find an app on the market and so, with the help of Patrick Orrell, I attempted to build my own. I started to understand what programming 
                was with Python and moved on JavaScript. During my time at Makers, I also studied Ruby and enjoyed learning another language. Whilst 
                self-learning I found myself dreaming of the code and that it was on my mind all the time. It became clear to me I was enjoying myself 
                coding and wanted to make it a career.

                    <p>This project was what I wanted to create before getting into Web development, unawre of the
                        various programming languages need to render what seems simple to a novice. This was also my
                        introduction into the world of databases, using MongoDB I was able to send and retrieve data
                        entered into my table. The use of Pug as a templating engine was applied, this was enjoyable and
                        interesting as it was a a simpler version of HTML. Express.js was used as my framework of
                        choice.</p>

                        local server. The aim of this project was to render the selected information using Ajax,
                        resulting in my app showing all the repos from Vue.js's GitHub account.</p>

                        Webpack as an addition due to it being built-in. I recreated my Vue v.2 project using Vue CLI
