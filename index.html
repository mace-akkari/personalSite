            <h3>About Me:</h3>
            <p>A self-motivated/taught Junior Front-End Developer. With the knowledge and guidance of my mentor
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-orrell-86a5a236">Patrick Orrell</a>,
                I have been fortunate enough to see how the world of front-end development works.
                A curiosity turned hobby and now aiming for a career, my love for the world of programming
                using JavaScript has grown and my thirst for knowledge grows the more I learn. I believe getting into
                founders and coders, will propel me to the next level and help me become an industry ready junior
                developer. Studying with founders and coders full time will allow me to turn all my focus and potential
                from
                a dream into reality.

                    <p>In this project I used a fetch API to retrieve the current price of a selected crypoto currency
                        in fiat money. I created this is app using only JavaScript to minipulate the DOM. Also applying
                        Webpack for the
                        first time to generate a local server</p>

                    <p>This project was what I wanted to create before G getting into Web development, unawre of the
                        various programming languages need to render what seems simple to a novice. This was also my
                        introduction into the world of databases, using MongoDB I was able to send and retrieve data
                        entered into my table. The use of Pug as a templating engine was applied, this was enjoyable and
                        interesting as it was a a simpler version of HTML. Express.js was used as my framework of
                        choice.</p>

                    <p>In this project I had chosen Vue.js as my framework of choice, using Webpack to have render a
                        local server. The aim of this project was to render the selected information using Ajax,
                        resulting in my app showing all the repos from Vue.js's GitHub account.</p>

                    <p>Further research into Vue led me to the path of Vue CLI, which I found did not require me to use
                        Webpack as an addition due to it being built-in. I recreated my Vue v.2 project using Vue CLI
