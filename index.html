        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I'm an alumnus of <a href="https://makers.tech">Makers</a>, looking
          for my first role as a Junior Web Developer. I originally studied
          Computer Science at Kingston University before becoming a Personal
          Trainer. Training individuals on a daily basis has enhanced my people
          skills. Every client is different, and I am able to adapt effectively
          to each one. Similar to programming, each client is like a project and
          has specifications of what they want to achieve within a given time.
          My client, now mentor,
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-orrell-86a5a236"
            >Patrick Orrell</a
          >, has helped guide me during my transition.

          <h3>CatchMe:</h3>
          <p>
            A two-week final project while at Makers Academy, in a team of four we
            created a mobile running app. React was the chosen framework while
            JavaScript Geolocation was used to track the individual user’s
            location. Sounds were added to buttons and the running page, this was
            one of the many new things I learnt whilst working on this app. This
            was an amazing project where I gained a priceless lesson in the value
            of planning and team work. While working with a mobile first approach,
            I experienced issues with different browsers and the need to learn
            cross-browser compatibility.

            My first experience working in a team, this one-week project is a Air
            BnB clone and was made using Ruby on Rails. We worked in an agile
            environment and used daily meetings and sprints to get the projected
            completed. SQL and tableplus were used to store the user data.

            I was intruiged by lucky packs in games and how the probability works.
            This slot machine game was done using vanilla JavaScript. This was the
            first time I used cookies to track the users score, importing
            cookie-parser.

            This project was what I wanted to create before getting into Web
            development, unawre of the various programming languages need to
            render what seems simple to a novice. This was also my introduction
            into the world of databases, using MongoDB I was able to send and
            retrieve data entered into my table. The use of Pug as a templating
            engine was applied, this was enjoyable and interesting as it was a a
            simpler version of HTML. Express.js was used as my framework of
            choice.

          <h3>Crypto Api using React:</h3>
          <p>
            My interest in crypto currency, gave me an idea to build a price
            tracker. This was my first attempt in building a project using React,
            I used a fetch API to retrieve the current price of a selected crypto
            currency in fiat money.

          <h3>Repo using Vue.js v.3:</h3>
          <p>
            The aim of this project was to render the selected information using
            Ajax, resulting in my app showing all the repos from Vue.js's GitHub
            account. This project is an update my Vue v.2 project. While learning
            and building my project, I found version 3 and that led me to the path
            of Vue CLI, which I found did not require me to use Webpack as an
            addition due to it being built-in.
