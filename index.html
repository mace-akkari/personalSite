        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Previously working at ReLyfe, where I coded daily in JavaScript, React, TypeScript 
          and Redux. Within the first month at ReLyfe I was tasked with setting up and 
          maintaining their Cypress testing suite. Given the opportunity to take on this project, 
          I spent time researching and presented my approach. Successfully implementing the testing 
          to all the pages enabled any errors to show up while being merged in the pipeline, if a test 
          were to fail, I would check the error message and fix it, enabling the blocked pipeline 
          to flow again.

          <h3>WhatsApp:</h3>
          <p>
            With the majority of people using WhatsApp, I wanted to see how hard it was to create a version 
            of it using Next.js. While I did use a tutorial for help, their use of Firebase and Firestore was 
            outdated so I had to spend a lot of time learning the new methods for using it. This project was 
            also the first time I used Google authentication.

          <h3>The Martian:</h3>
          <p>
            Whilst watching a movie called The Martian, I was intrigued by how they were communicating with each other. 
            Taking up an interest, I began to research HEX and different base systems. Spinning up React, 
            I tried recreating the scene in which Mark communicates with NASA using the rover. 
            Mark is able to write in English, while NASA can only use the characters available in hex.

          <p>
            This blog project was a way for me to learn Next.js and Sanity. 
            A simple project that communicates with the backend
            and user comments that needed to be verified before being displayed on the site.

          <h3>CatchMe:</h3>
          <p>
            A two-week final project while at Makers Academy, in a team of four we
            created a mobile running app. React was the chosen framework while
            JavaScript Geolocation was used to track the individual user’s
            location. Sounds were added to buttons and the running page, this was
            one of the many new things I learnt whilst working on this app. This
            was an amazing project where I gained a priceless lesson in the value
            of planning and team work. While working with a mobile first approach,
            I experienced issues with different browsers and the need to learn
            cross-browser compatibility.

            My first experience working in a team, this one-week project is a Air
            BnB clone and was made using Ruby on Rails. We worked in an agile
            environment and used daily meetings and sprints to get the projected
            completed. SQL and tableplus were used to store the user data.

            I was intruiged by lucky packs in games and how the probability works.
            This slot machine game was done using vanilla JavaScript. This was the
            first time I used cookies to track the users score, importing
            cookie-parser.

          <p>
            This project was what I wanted to create before getting into Web
            development, unawre of the various programming languages need to
            render what seems simple to a novice. This was also my introduction
            into the world of databases, using MongoDB I was able to send and
            retrieve data entered into my table. The use of Pug as a templating
            engine was applied, this was enjoyable and interesting as it was a a
            simpler version of HTML. Express.js was used as my framework of
            choice.
